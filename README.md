# CardConnect
This was a project done in 3rd year of CASE in DCU with [Luke Edgeworth](https://github.com/Ledge123). the core premise was to create an app that utilised NFC cards as a way to transfer business
information between your work colleagues easily. The app is on the android platform and coded in java. for more information, you can read the doc in the User Manual Folder. 
We've also included video links for demonstration
