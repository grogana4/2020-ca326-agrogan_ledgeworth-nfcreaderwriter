#### Project Description:


This project consists of a NFC card based app for a phone. Near field communication (NFC) is a wireless technology that allows a device to collect and interpret data from another closely located NFC device or tag. Specifically, NFC is a branch of High-Frequency (HF) RFID. Radio Field Identification (RFID) is the process by which items are uniquely identified using radio waves, and NFC is a specialized subset within the family of RFID technology. and both operate at 13.56 MHz. NFC is designed to be a secure form of data exchange, and an NFC device is capable of being both an NFC reader and an NFC tag. This unique feature allows NFC devices to communicate peer-to-peer. Seeing that the NFC function is becoming more commonplace on a phone due to contactless payment services, such as Apple or Google play, this seemed like an interesting field to look into. The app will have a template for adding contact information such as a photo, email, phone number or external media like a website or video link. There is also an idea for creating group contacts on a single card or using notes within a person’s contact to present a list of associates. Users could get their card custom printed. Users will give these cards to their customers/other businesses and not only can they have an impressive, stylish business card, but also have a quick way of digitally networking with other users who have the app or cards like them. Users can view these other card on the app, but they cannot edit them if the NFC card is permanently locked, which a user can also choose to do.


#### Division of work:
The division of work will hopefully be split between the both of us. We will both have to learn how to code an app for Android and get it working with NFC card as part of our feasibility study. We will perform pair programming for this project, however, if there are time constraints within the day of working, we will agree to set individual tasks for each other.


#### Programming Languages and Tools:
We will be using Java as our programming language and IntelliJ IDEA as our tool to code to Android (Java is the official language of Android, while intelliJ has an android Studio Development Kit).

##### Learning Challenges:
The learning challenges of this project will be coding an Android app. This why we’re going to conduct a feasibility study to see if we can actually code an Android App that can run on our phones and read and write to NFC cards.

#### Hardware/Software Platform:
We will be working on Windows 10 on a PC and Android  on our phones.


#### Special Hardware/Software Requirements:
The only requirement we have for this project is NFC cards, which will be easy to obtain.
